I am tired of the single line URL toolbars in web browsers which hasn't changed in 20 years. If you are 
modifying URLs that contain lots of parameters, then this extension will help you by taking the URL and 
placing each url parameter key/value pair into an editable table. You can edit the parameter name and/or value and click
the "Update" button to refresh the page with the new parameter name/values. If there are bugs, please
file them in github and happy URL editing!
